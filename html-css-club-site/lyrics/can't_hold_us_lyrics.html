				<li>[Intro:]</li>
				<li>Ay, ay, ay</li>
				<li>Good to see you, come on in, let's go</li>
				<li>Yeah, let's go</li>
				<li>Alright, alright</li>
				<li>OK, uh, alright, OK</li>
				<li>Alright, OK</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>Return of the Mack, get up!</li>
				<li>What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't.</li>
				<li>Looking for a better way to get up out of bed</li>
				<li>Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me.</li>
				<li>Get up! Fresh out, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious</li>
				<li>Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy</li>
				<li>Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,</li>
				<li>And we did it our way.</li>
				<li>Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it</li>
				<li>And yet I'm on...</li>
				<li>Let that stage light go and shine on down,</li>
				<li>Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.</li>
				<li>Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,</li>
				<li>But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town</li>
				<li>Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler,</li>
				<li>Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four track bussing</li>
				<li>Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit.</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>Labels out here,</li>
				<li>Now they can't tell me nothing</li>
				<li>We give that to the people,</li>
				<li>Spread it across the country</li>
				<li>Labels out here,</li>
				<li>Now they can't tell me nothing</li>
				<li>We give it to the people,</li>

				<li>Can we go back, this is the moment</li>
				<li>Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over</li>
				<li>So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us</li>
				<li>Like the ceiling can't hold us</li>
				<li>Can we go back, this is the moment</li>
				<li>Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over</li>
				<li>So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us</li>
				<li>Like the ceiling can't hold us</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful.</li>
				<li>I grew up, really wanted gold fronts</li>
				<li>But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you</li>
				<li>Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat</li>
				<li>And I'm eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on shark week</li>
				<li>Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!</li>
				<li>Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome,</li>
				<li>Caesar'll make you a believer. Nah I never ever did it for a throne.</li>
				<li>That validation comes from giving it back to the people. Nah sing this song and it goes like</li>
				<li>"Raise those hands, this is our party</li>
				<li>We came here to live life like nobody was watching"</li>
				<li>I got my city right behind me</li>
				<li>If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves</li>
